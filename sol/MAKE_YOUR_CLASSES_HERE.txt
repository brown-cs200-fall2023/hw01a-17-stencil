All classes that you create should go in this directory (sol).

You can crate a class in IntelliJ like this:
 1. Click on the "sol" package on the left side
 2. In the menus at the top, select File > New > Java Class
 3. Type the name of the class and press Enter

This will create a class file here that should be set up to work with our stencil.

Please do not submit this file to the autograder--you can even delete it.
